# Project calculator
This project, as seen by its description, seeks to take in a mathematical expression and render it.
This will be made for Numworks calculators, so memory is a big factor in this, and will be traded for time.

## To-do

- [x] Compress a SVG (or rather composite Bezier curves) into memory-saving strings
- [x] Render this string back into a bunch of curves
- [ ] Add width compatibility and width scaling
- [ ] Render one character after another
- [ ] Add support for handles
- [ ] More?
